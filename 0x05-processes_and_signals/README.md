# Processes and Signals in C

This project covers the basics of **processes** and **signals** in C. Processes are independent executing instances of a program, created and managed using functions like `fork()` and `exec()`. Signals are a way to communicate with processes asynchronously, using functions like `kill()` to send signals and `signal()` to handle them. These concepts are critical for developing multitasking applications and managing inter-process communication effectively in C.
