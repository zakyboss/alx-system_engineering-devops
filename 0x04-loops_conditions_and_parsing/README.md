Looking at loops conditions and parsing # Loops, Conditions, and Parsing in C

This project focuses on fundamental C programming concepts: **loops**, which enable repetitive execution of code (using `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops); **conditional statements**, like `if-else` and `switch`, which control program flow based on logical conditions; and **parsing**, which involves extracting and interpreting data from inputs using functions like `sscanf`. These are essential tools for building efficient, flexible, and dynamic programs in C.
